Raspberry Pi 4 PCIe Bridge "Chip"
==================================

## What's New
* Added gerber for submission to fab house. Testing with JLCPCB at 1.0mm thick.

## Project Description
A drop-in replacement for the VL805 USB controller IC that bridges the PCIe bus signals to the USB 3.0 connector on the Raspberry Pi 4.

The PCB is 8x10mm, but the chip is 8x8mm. You likely need to cut about 1mm off each edge of the PCB to make it fit and align the pins.
